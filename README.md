# Drowsiness-Detection-using-Python-main
 Drowsiness Detection  is a project aimed at monitoring a person's alertness, particularly in situations where staying awake is critical, such as driving. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect signs of drowsiness in real-time and can trigger an alert if the person appears to be falling asleep.
